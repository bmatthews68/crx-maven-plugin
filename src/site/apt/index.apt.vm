  The structure of a Google Chrome Extension project is as follows:

  /pom.xml
  /src/main/chrome/manifest.json
  /src/main/chrome/*

  <project>
      <groupId>btmatthews.com</groupId>
      <artifactId>SecureMailExtension</artifactId>
      <version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
      <packaging>crx</packaging>
      <build>
          <plugins>
              <plugin>
                   <groupId>com.btmatthews.maven.plugins</groupId>
                   <artifactId>crx-maven-plugin</artifactId>
                   <version>${project.version}</version>
                   <extensions>true</extensions>
                   <configuration>
                       <pemFile>...</pemFile>
                       <pemPassword>...</pemPassword>
                   </configuration>
               </plugin>
           </plugins>
       </project>
  </project>

  This will produce a file in the target directory with the .crx file extension.
